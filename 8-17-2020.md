# What I worked on for developing skills

- STILL chipping away at that react Scrimba course but I've been redoing a lot of em and now I'm at the "react meme generator capstone"
- Got some Udemy courses including a Webdev 2020 course that I'm going through a bit to brush up on HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS etc. Nothing too serious but I don't want to forget
- Haven't done much hacking but I built my pwnagotchi a week ago or so. That's cool.

## Job search updates

- Lol job declines
- Applied to probably close to a hundred jobs. Most way out of my league.
  - got my fastest decline though...sent a message to someone at the company on linkedin and within minutes of doing that I got the "no ty" email
    - and it was for an entry level software support role smh
- Applied to some state help desk jobs
- Attending webinars and stuff and trying not to lose hope already
- Bought a domain for my portfolio and maybe blog? Whatever keeps me sane I guess.
- Portfolio updated and working on GH Pages!
- Maxx Potential looks promising but so did Microsot LEAP lmao

### What I need to do

- Continue practicing skills
- More projects for portfolio
- Apply to more positions
- Finish career services suggestions for resume, portfolio website
- Finish Accounting for WGU

#### The excuse:

Too busy to type up 30 lines in a markdown file that no one is going to read lol. Also just kinda forgot I was doing this but in order to form a habit you have to do something like a thousand times or something...well, good habits. I don't think you can apply that to alcoholism or drugs.
